# Titanic-Survival-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
The Titanic Survival Prediction Project is a machine learning-based analysis aimed at
 predicting the likelihood of a passenger's survival during the Titanic disaster. The
 problem is derived from the famous Kaggle competition: "Titanic- Machine Learning
 from Disaster." The primary objective of this project is to apply classification algorithms
 to predict survival (Survived) based on various passenger attributes such as age, gender,
 ticket class, and fare.
 This project provides an excellent opportunity to explore key concepts in data
 preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. By leveraging machine
 learning, we aim to solve a classification problem while learning practical data science
 skills. The motivation stems from the need to understand survival patterns in historical
 datasets, enabling better decision-making in similar scenarios.
